# Workshop In Applied Ethics

---

### Answer the Questions

**1. If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?**

If all people were ethical in all their interactions the centerpiece of modern society that would be obviated would be the judiciary branch. Laws are ethical norms but do not apply to everyone. If everyone in the world applied to the same kind of ethics then there would be no need for the judiciary branch.

**2. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.**
	
An event from recent history that favored a group to the detriment of the indiviual that is still a topic today is abortion laws. This favors the more modern conservative ideolgy groups than the indiviuals choice on what to do with their body. This favors one group to the other.

**3. (BONUS) Ethical codes are vulnerable to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). An ethical code relies on the _cooperation_ of the individuals. Discuss how rogue behavior (aka _defection_) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the [prinsoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) and the eventual demise of the ethical code. What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?**

By putting safeguards to prevent rogue members and rogue behavior is key to preventing the fall of the group. The way in which we can prevent rogue activities is by having a system of technological mutation within the group which is set up in different security levels which ask for permission before allowing access, having one group to not stay in his position too long and switches off to ensure that the group who comes after ensures its in check, and by ensuring a small number of people to one group with frequent checks to ensure the Code of ethics is being upheld. We will also use a reward system for the code of ethics being apllied to further give people a reason to follow the code. 

### Class Activities
**1. In a small group up to 5 people, imagine you are a small _tech_ startup. Then:**
   **1. List the group members below.**
   
 	* Vincent
	* Jessica
	* Leean
	* Bruce
	* Joaquin
	
 **2. Pick a president and write their name below.**
   
   The President of our group is Vincent.
    
   **3. Describe your technical innovation below.**
   
   Our technical innovation is a computer that can run any software, such as any operating system, any language, etc.
   
   **1. Below, list at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to _misuse_) of the innovation and anticipatory actions and mechanisms you can embed that**
   
   Adverse effects: It would make it harder for humans to adapt to different softwares and userinterfaces, it would harm the enviroment by having people throw out their old laptops, and it would affect the job market because of companies losing competition because of our computer can run any software/OS.
   
   Helpful effects: It would make it easier for developers, it would bring more developers because of the excitement, and it would allow the people to benefit by having economic freedom.
   
   **2. Below, give an _explicit_ definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of its lifetime: (i) immediately upon launch; (ii) after enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life.**
   
   The good upon launch: The good of our product after launch would be the ability to run any software in one place allowing for developers to only use one device for all their work. This would also make news and help bring more developers because of the new ability to use only one piece of equipment to run any software.
   
   The bad upon launch: The bad of our product after launch would be an increase in disposal of tech which would make the enviroment suffer for this product.
   
   The good after absorbed: The good of our product after it has been absorbed would be that it would lose the ability to adapt to user interfaces and software
   
   The bad after absorded: The bad after our product was absorded would be that it would hurt major tech companies putting people out of jobs and hurting a certain section of the economy
   
**3. Your small "[band of merry psychopaths](#the-band)" are the pivotal social kernel that can define the proper use of your technology. You have to start early, and hold the line. How are you going to ensure that you stay the course?**
	
To ensure that our creation is holding on to our orginial idea and intentions we must have a Code of Ethics thats followed.

   **1. Below, define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization that will safeguard your original intentions and values while not stiflying innovation as your startup grows and matures.**
   
   1. Follow copyright laws, our work will be honest and original. 
     No products we design or build will violate any laws or regulations that apply.
     
  2. Be transparent, let the user know exactly what data/information we are recieving and taking.
     All information gathered by the company will be secure and used only for the purposes stated. We will never sell or otherwise
     compromise customer or suppier infomation.
     
  3. All employees and officers of the company will avoid conflics of interest.
     No employee of the company will engage in any activity that is in conflict with the goals of the company. Further no employee with 
     hold employment of any kind with a competing company or a company we do business with. 
     
  4. No employee will accept or convey a bribery. 
     No employee will accept or give lavish gifts to or from anyone we do business with. Lavish is defined as anything with a monitary
     value over ($100.00) One Hundred Dollars. 
     
  5. Our product/software will be accessible to everyone who seeks it.
     Our product is intended to help people every where. To this end we will not discriminate in any way against any one. 
     
  6. Our employees are the heart of our buisiness and will treat each other with respect, fairness, and equally.
     No employee will create a hostile uncomfortable envirnment for any other employee. 
     Passionate, efficient and skilled people make a significant contribution to our success. We expect and
     promote an entrepreneurial mindset, innovative thinking, people taking initiative, reliability and a sense of
     responsibility.
     
  7. Customers will be trated with respect, fairness, equally, and with dilligence.
     Without customers we have no business. There fore each customer will recieve the same service and care we expect ourselves. Our 
     customer service will have the same high quality standards as our products.
     
  8. Honor customer confidientiality.
     We will never sell or otherwise compromise customer or suppier infomation.
     
  9. Produce highest quality possible.
     The pursuit of quality is core to our approach in everything we do. 
     Our products are designed and built to the highest technical standards and offer excellent functionality and ease of
     use.

4. **(BONUS) Ethical codes are vulnerable to _hostile takeover_ of the adopting organization. Pick one person from your group and let them _remove 3 points_ from your Code, at their discretion, to be the most damaging overall.**

**Bruce's criticisms** 
	1.*Follow copyright laws, our work will be honest and original
	2. *Be transparent, let the user know exactly what data/information we are recieving and taking
	3. *No employee will accept or convey a bribery.
	
  **1. Below, discuss how and why the Code has been weakened.**
  
  The code is weakened because in in 1. it slowers production of our product but in return it loses public trust. In 2. it still allows for people to break this rule knowly with no punishment stated will be done. In 3. it allows for the whole company to be bought out it must have safeguards for the railment of the company or group. 
  
   **2. Below, discuss how, in retrospect, you should have stated the points of the Code, to make it _robust to disruption_.**
   
   I would keep the point of the point of copy right laws unless we had enough monbey to battle it in the courts. I would for point 2 add some kind of procedure that was severe enough to make sure the chance of this being broken very slim such as job loss. For point 3 I would right that not only employee but the company or group should having meetings on company choices and ensure it follows our values and intentions.
